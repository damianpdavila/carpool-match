A web app to help school families carpool with each other.  Initially focused on the families of one given school; in future could be generalized to work with any school or really any carpool destination.

## Features

* Set match preferences:  max distance to carpool, offering (pick up only, drop off only, both, neither(rider)), time to leave for school, etc.
* Display matching profiles in list and on map
* Enable user to contact matches in order to finalize carpool. Contactee's information is not disclosed for privacy reasons.
* Broadcast to all users whenever new user joins so can find/refine their matches.
